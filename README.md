## Diwali-Sales
### Introduction
The Data set contains about 11,000 rows of sales info related to diwali purchases. Key columns describe the customers info including their age, marital status and geographic demographics. There are also columns informing us about the products that were bought and the categroies that they belong to.

After Initial obersevation, I decided to check for the following answers:

Who are the top buyers
Age Group that made the most number of purchases
Gender Sales
Top Product categories
Top Occupations that made most purchases
